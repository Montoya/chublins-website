      <p>Due to an error with the original Chublins contract, most of the supply went to botters. Rather than letting them make a profit they don't deserve, a new Chublins contract will be launched with a fair allowlist + strict wallet limit. People who participated in the mint and bought on secondary during the first day of sales will be given an opportunity to join this allowlist. More details will be shared soon via Twitter. Thanks.</p>
